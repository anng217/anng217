👋 Hi, I’m @anng217. PhD in Management Information Systems at Georgia State Univeristy. Welcome to my messy nest of thoughts, concocations of homework and (not even) half-done projects.

💞️ I’d love to collaborate on research on digital economics, labor markets, and entrepreneurship.

📫 Reach me at anguyen192@student.gsu.edu
